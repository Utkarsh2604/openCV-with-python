'''
This python file detects objects in real-time
To run this file clone the CAFFE model used in this file from https://github.com/y-pankaj/Caffe-files-for-object-detection
The repo contains two files. One of them is the pretrained CAFFE model which contains the weights and the other files is to deploy this model in out python file
Put both the files in the same directory as this python file and then run this python file ( python real_time_object_detection.py for ubuntu)
This file makes use of dnn module of OpenCV for object detection.
The below code has comments along with it to make this file understandable.
